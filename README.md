# 🔥 HeatSync

**HeatSync** is a demo platform that simulates PCM-based (Phase Change Material) thermal energy storage and heat flow for sustainable energy systems. It visualizes how heat is stored, released, and managed using assumed input values and simplified modeling.

---

## 📌 What It Does

- Models heat transfer in systems using PCM
- Visualizes temperature evolution and thermal behavior
- Demonstrates core principles behind energy-efficient heating
- Web-based interface built with Python (Flask) and frontend libraries

---

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

This is a **proof-of-concept** project. The simulation is built on **assumed material properties, environmental conditions**, and simplified formulas for demonstration purposes only. It is not calibrated for real-world engineering decisions.

---

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- Python / Flask
- Matplotlib / NumPy
- HTML / CSS / JS (Plotly or Chart.js for graphs)
- Hosted with Netlify (Frontend) / Local Flask server (Backend)
